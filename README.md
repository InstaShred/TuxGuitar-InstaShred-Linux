## Requirements
TuxGuitar-InstaShred-Linux requires your computer to have a BLE/Bluetooth module, TuxGuitar installed (Java 9 minimum requirement) and an InstaShred guitar.  

## Installation Instructions
Download and install the appropriate Linux release from the [Source Forge project site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/files/TuxGuitar/).

Navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/InstaShred/TuxGuitar-InstaShred-Linux/releases/tag/initial_release) and download tuxguitar-instashred--SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar file. Save this file in the /share/plugins directory of your TuxGuitar installation. If you are having trouble finding this directory, right click your TuxGuitar shortcut and select "Open file location".

Run TuxGuitar.exe, and the Bluetooth search window (Discovered Devices) should open automatically. If not go to "Tools > Plugins" and make sure the "InstaShred" plugin is enabled. Once the Bluetooth search window appears, select your InstaShred guitar before pressing "Connect". After a successful connection, the connected lightshow will display on your guitar and the Bluetooth search window will close. 

You are now ready to use TuxGuitar with your InstaShred guitar!
